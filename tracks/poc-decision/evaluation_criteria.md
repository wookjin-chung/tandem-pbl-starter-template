# Evaluation Criteria (For Enterprises)

## Evaluation Focus
Participants are NOT evaluated on:
- PoC success
- Code completeness

Participants ARE evaluated on:
- Clarity of reasoning
- Risk awareness
- Decision logic
- Ability to justify stopping

## Key Questions for Reviewers
- Are assumptions explicit?
- Are success/stop criteria realistic?
- Is the final decision defensible?
- Would you trust this person to run a real PoC?
