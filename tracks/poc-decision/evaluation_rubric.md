# PoC Decision Evaluation Rubric
*(For Enterprise HR, Innovation, and R&D Teams)*

---

## Purpose

This rubric evaluates a candidate’s ability to **design, judge, and stop PoCs**.

- PoC success is **NOT** the evaluation target.
- Code completeness is **NOT** the evaluation target.
- Decision logic, risk awareness, and stopping judgment **ARE** the evaluation targets.

---

## Core Evaluation Principle

> This is a **decision-making assessment**, not a technical skills test.

---

## Scoring Overview

- Total Score: **100 points**
- Evaluation Areas: 5
- Primary Signal: **Ability to justify stopping or proceeding**

---

## 1. Problem Definition & Task Selection (20 points)

| Level | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 0 pts | Task is vague or undefined |
| 10 pts | Task is defined but boundaries are unclear |
| 20 pts | One task is clearly defined with explicit PoC suitability reasoning |

**Reviewer Questions**
- Why was this task selected?
- Why is this task appropriate (or inappropriate) for a PoC?

---

## 2. Assumptions & Risk Awareness (20 points)

| Level | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 0 pts | Assumptions are implicit or missing |
| 10 pts | Some assumptions identified |
| 20 pts | All critical assumptions clearly stated and prioritized |

**Risk Dimensions to Look For**
- Technical limitations
- Environmental variability
- Operational constraints
- Human interaction factors

**Reviewer Questions**
- Which assumption is most likely to fail first?
- Are non-technical risks recognized?

---

## 3. Success & Stop Criteria Definition (25 points)

| Level | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 0 pts | No measurable criteria |
| 12 pts | Partial or ambiguous criteria |
| 25 pts | Clear, measurable, and realistic success AND stop criteria |

**Key Indicators**
- Quantifiable metrics (time, accuracy, safety, cost)
- Explicit stop conditions
- Willingness to justify termination

**Reviewer Questions**
- At what point should this PoC be stopped?
- Why is stopping the correct decision?

> ⚠️ This category carries the highest weight.

---

## 4. Failure Interpretation & Learning Ability (20 points)

| Level | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 0 pts | Failure = lack of technology |
| 10 pts | Partial root cause analysis |
| 20 pts | Clear distinction between technical and decision failures |

**Reviewer Questions**
- What does failure teach us?
- How does this inform the next PoC design?

---

## 5. Overall Decision Quality & Trustworthiness (15 points)

| Level | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 0 pts | Conclusion without reasoning |
| 8 pts | Reasoning exists but lacks coherence |
| 15 pts | Logical consistency across all decisions |

**Final Reviewer Question**
- Would you trust this person to own a real PoC decision?

---

## Score Interpretation Guide

| Total Score | Interpretation |
|------------|----------------|
| 80–100 | Ready to lead PoC decisions independently |
| 60–79 | Suitable as PoC support or co-owner |
| 40–59 | Requires additional PoC decision training |
| < 40 | Not suitable for PoC decision roles |

---

## Notes for Reviewers

- This rubric is designed to be used **before hiring**, **before large investment**, and **before scaling**.
- Strong candidates may **stop PoCs early** — this is a positive signal.
- Weak candidates often try to “make it work” at all costs.
