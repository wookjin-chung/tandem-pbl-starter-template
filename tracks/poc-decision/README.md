# PoC Decision Track (Enterprise)

This track is not about building robots or writing perfect code.

It is about learning how to **decide**:
- whether a PoC should start,
- where it should stop,
- and when it should scale.

Participants in this track are evaluated not by success,
but by the **quality of their decisions and reasoning**.

If you are looking for a coding tutorial, this is not it.
If you want to understand why most PoCs fail — this is where you start.
