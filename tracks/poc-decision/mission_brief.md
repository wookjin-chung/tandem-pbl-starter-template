# PoC Mission Brief

## Mission Objective
This mission does NOT aim to execute a full PoC.

The objective is to determine:
- whether a specific task is suitable for a PoC,
- under what conditions it may succeed,
- and when it should be stopped.

## Constraints
- Only ONE task may be selected.
- No real hardware deployment is required.
- Full automation is NOT expected.
- The mission duration is limited to 2–3 weeks.

## Expected Outcome
A clear decision supported by reasoning:
- Proceed
- Modify and retry
- Stop
